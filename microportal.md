# Portal

??? Draft ???

The ESP boards cannot only be used for supporting electronic devices like sensors, switches or built into devices but can also be used as a general purpose web server.

So why not using a board to create a web portal that combines the functionality of multiple devices into a single presentation.


## Boards List

The boards you like to see in the portal can be added to a list that can be configured manually or by listening to incoming SSDP packages. These boards can be seen in the configuration page where checkboxes can be used to enable them in the main navigation.

The order of the registered boards can be rearranged.


## Reuse existing Boards

The Homeding devices already have a good presentation UI of the functionality defined by the local configured elements on the board page.

This dashboard is reused in the portal when a devices is selected in the main menu by showing the configured standard page of the device.

Because the title and menu of these boards consume a lot of space these are hidden when the page detects that the used window is not the top window e.g. the page is displayed inside the portal.


 that should also be available 

* implementation model that combines static resources and JavaScript functionality in the browser with special REST based services.

* automatic and manual registration of devices in the local network

* SSDP receiver

* reuse http connection


* clock

* monitor
