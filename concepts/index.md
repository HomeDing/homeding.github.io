description: Insights into the design of an IoT device,
excerpt: >
  The HomeDing library is made to build devices connected to a local WiFi network
  that deliver a full functional solution without the need to use a central
  server or external cloud services. Here are the conceptual ideas influencing the design
  of the HomeDing library.

The conceptional goals are

* IoT devices can be used standalone
* Easy to be used
* Using the Arduino Environment for development
* Full control just by using a web browser
* Options may include networking and cloud features

The solution should be usable by everyone from pupils to professionals by
offering multiple entry points for using the library and examples.

A leaning path is provided from simply using examples, extending the examples
up to extending the core library functionality.
