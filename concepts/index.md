The HomeDing library is made to build devices connected to a local WiFi network
that deliver a full functional solution without the need to use a central
server or external cloud services.

The conceptional ideas are

- IoT devices can be used standalone
- Easy to be used
- Using the Arduino Environment for development
- Full control just by using a web browser

The solution should be usable by everyone from pupils to professionals by
offering multiple entry points for using the library and examples.

A leaning path is provided from simply using examples, extending the examples
up to extending the core library functionality.
