# Welcome to the HomeDing wiki

Building your own connected Things made easy.

This library targets building small devices for a typical in-house environment, connected to the local WLAN without the need for a central hub or bridge device.

This allows building small self-contained Things that are easy to be created.

It is made especially for the ESP8266 boards like the NodeMCU or similar ones.

## Available Elements

The [Available Elements](availableelements) in the HomeDing library are the blocks for building the overall functionality of a device.

Each of them supports a unique feature, reads a sensor, drives displays and other periphery or implements some internal logic.

A full list can be found here: [AvailableElements](availableelements)

It is easy to implement your own specific custom elements as you can see in the [Examples](examples)
