Building your own connected Things made easy.

This library targets building small devices for a typical in-house environment, connected to the local WLAN without the need for a central hub or bridge device.

This allows building small self-contained Things that are easy to be created.

It is made especially for the ESP8266 boards like the NodeMCU or similar ones.
