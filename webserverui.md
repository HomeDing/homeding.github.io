# WebServer User Interface ???

The devices created using the HomeDing library 
can be used as standalone IoT devices because they can directly be accessed by a browser thanks to the built-in web server and the provided UI.

This UI pages are hosted on the device itself. They are implemented respecting the small available memory but provide some powerful functions to even configure and customise the device.

## Home Page 

This landing page when the device is opened using the URL with the devicename. 

It contains the links to the available functions and offers some insights to some technical runtime parameters.

## Dashboard

On this page every element is shown on a card and shows the actual runtime parameters like sensor values.

In the standard view the system related elements are not visualized. By using the [sys] button they can be shown as well.

On this page it is possible to create new elements based on the available elements in the collection that has been compiled. 

For existing elements the config parameters can be modified.
