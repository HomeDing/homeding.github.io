## Board sonoff

Sonoff ITEAD is a brand for several off-the-shelf Smart Home WLAN devices like switches that use the ESP8266 chip.

They were one of the first companies selling these type of devices to the market.
Today many brands use these chips and there is a huge community that supports re-flashing these devices with a new firmware.

The tasmota implementation is one with constant support to even new devices from other brands.
