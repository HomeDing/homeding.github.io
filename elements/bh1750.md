description: Support of the environment light sensor based on the BH1750 chip.
excerpt: >
  The BH1750Element allows retrieving the environment light intensity from BH1750 based sensors
  using the i2c bus for communication
---

From the values of the sensor the lightness in lumen (lx) can directly be calculated as the sensor delivers a linear equivalence.

The actual conversion factor can be given by a setup parameter.

The i2c bus interface offers a simple communication implementation with the sensor so no external library is required.

The sensor offers 3 different resolutions each in continuous or single measurement mode.
The Element implementation supports the 3 modes of taking single probes and the timing parameters of the [Sensor Element] implementation.


## Element Configuration

<!-- <object data="/element.svg?bh1750" type="image/svg+xml"></object> -->

The following properties are available for configuration of the element:

> **address** - The I2C Address of the sensor. The default value is 0x23.
> 
> **factor** - The factor used to convert the raw sensor value into lumen (lx). The default value is
1.2 from the datasheet.
> 
> **mode** - The resolution mode of the sensor to be used:
> * 0: 1 lux resolution, Measurement time about 120ms.
> * 1: 0.5 lux resolution, Measurement time about 120ms.
> * 3: 4 lux resolution, Measurement time about 16ms.
