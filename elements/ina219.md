# INA219 / INA260

The INA219 is a current and voltage sensor that uses the I2C bus for communication and can easily be adapted to any Arduino microcontroller
including ESP6266 and EPS32. It can be powered by 3.3V to 5V but can measure voltages up to 26V.

It can be used as a monitor for voltage and current but also provides power consumption calculation  

## Sensor Connectivity

The sensor chip uses a 3.3 V Supply voltage on VCC and GND and needs to be connected to the SDA and SCL line of the I2C bus. The I2C pins are configured using the properties of the device element and the I2C bus is normally chared by multiple elements e.g. sensors.

```json
{
  "device": {
    "0": {
      "i2c-scl": "D2",
      "i2c-sda": "D1"
    }
  }
}
```

The default I2C address of the INA219 on the I2C bus is 0x40.


## Element Configuration

The following properties are available for configuration of the element.

**address** - The I2C address of the sensor. The default value is 0x40.

**readTime** -??? Time between 2 probes from the sensor are fetched. The default value is 1 minute.


### Example configuration
