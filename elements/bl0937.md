description: Support the HLW8012 and BL0937 chip for single phase energy monitoring.
excerpt: >
  The BL0937Element has been implemented to support single phase energy monitoring
  using BL0937, HLW8012 or HJL-01 chips that are used in some retail plugs and switches.
---

All of these chips work the same by sending pulse signals that represent voltage, current and power. They have the same chip layout and pins.
As they directly work with the main power signals, only using some resistors to reduce high voltage and high current they are not intended to be used on DIY IoT devices.
The HLW8012 is an older model while the HJL-01/BL0937 is a newer more stable version.

:::warning

* This warning is serious.
* Never handle projects that are connected to the mains voltage.
* Stay away from devices with contact to mains voltage.
* Uploading firmware to devices that have contact to mains voltage is dangerous.
* DO NOT connect the any device to the mains during flashing or while using the serial interface.
* You may kill your computer and yourself.
* The USB-Serial adapters offer enough power to flash the device.
* When you are making these kind of projects you really need to know what you are doing.
* I have warned you, do not blame on me.

:::

The chip is directly working on the power line signals by measuring voltages and current. This part of the chip is lined out in detail in the datasheet.
From this measurements the chip creates 38 micro seconds pulses on 2 pins that need to be captured by the microprocessor.

These chips can monitor power consumption side by side to monitoring either current or voltage.

The timing of these impulses will be used to calculate the power consumption, actual current and actual voltage. A device specific factor needs to be provided for all the calculations.


## Web UI for the BL0937 Element

There is a dedicated card for this element available that shows the actual measured values and can switch between voltage and current mode.

When you find your device in the Template list at <https://templates.blakadder.com/all.html>
and its functionality mentions a BL0937 or HLW8012 chip like the
<https://templates.blakadder.com/gosund_SP111.html> it is likely to be supported by this element.

Here you can also detect the GPIOs used connecting to the chip (SEL, CF, CF1).


## Calibration

Most devices with these chips differ in the accuracy of the pulses. Therefore to get good results the default factors should overwritten in the configuration.

The get the device specific factors a reference load is required where the power consumption is known or use another good power measuring tool.
The best results are given by pure resistor loads like classic light bulbs. Here a 100W light is used.

* call <http://socket01/api/state/bl0937/0?cycletime=5000> to create a more precise pulse monitoring 5 sec cycles can be used.
* call <http://socket01/api/state/bl0937/0?mode=voltage>
* Switch on and wait some cycles (30secs).
* call <http://socket01/api/state/bl0937/0?poweradjust=100> to adjust the powerfactor
* call <http://socket01/api/state/bl0937/0?voltageadjust=226> to adjust the voltagefactor
* calculate the current in mA using the formula current = watt/voltage*1000
* call <http://socket01/api/state/bl0937/0> and see the powerfactor and voltagefactor
* call <http://socket01/api/state/bl0937/0?mode=current>

enter the 3 factors into the configuration.


## How the chip works

![BL0937 Pins](/elements/bl0937pins.png)

To meassure voltage and current the chips are connected via resistors to the main power signals.
A special load resistor is required to measure the current and the resulting voltage over the resistor
is then probed by the chip.

Voltage or current can be measured alternatively but the energy monitoring is active permanently.

The result of the measurement are impulses on the CF (energy) and CF1 (Voltage or Current) pins.

The BL0937 Element captures these pulses using the nanosecond timer to calculate the values.

| Pin  | symbol | Description                                                                |
| ---- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | VDD    | Chip power supply (+3.3V):                                                 |
| 2, 3 | IP, IN | Input of the current channel with a maximum differential voltage of ±50mV. |
| 4    | VP     | Input of the voltage signal with a maximum of ±200mV.                      |
| 5    | GND    | Chip ground.                                                               |
| 6    | CF     | Actual power frequency pulse output.                                       |
| 7    | CF1    | Actual current or voltage high-frequency pulse output.                     |
| 8    | SEL    | current / voltage output selection                                         |

The pins CF and CF1 produce signals:

> **SEL signal** - This signal is given by the element to the chip to switch between voltage and current measurement. It can be switched by the `mode` property of the element.
>
> **CF signal** - This signal emits pulses where the frequency is proportional to the power consumption.
> The maximal frequency is about 6,78 KHz when the limit of the sensor is reached.
>
> **CF1 signal** - This signal emits pulses where the frequency is proportional to the current or voltage value to be measured.
