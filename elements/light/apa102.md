excerpt: >
  The APA102 Element implements using LED Stripes and LED panels
  based on the apa102 chip and protocol and provides some color animations and transitions.
---

These LED stripes and RGB LEDs are using a 2 wire interface
with to sends RGB values with a 2-wire protocol using a clock and data line.
They allow high transfer rates and reliable data transmission.

Multiple LEDs on a single data line are chained so the data goes through the first LED to the next one.
Every LED is taking of the very first RGB value and passes on all the others.


## Element Configuration

The following properties are available for configuration of the element.

<object data="/element.svg?apa102" type="image/svg+xml"></object>




> **datapin**\* -- The GPIO pin that is used for data transmission to the first LED in the chain.
>
> **clockpin**\* -- The GPIO pin that is used for clock signal to the first LED in the chain.

{% include "./stripeproperties.md" %}

{% include "../elementproperties.md" %}

\* This parameter must be specified.


### Configuration Example

This example shows how to configure this element:

``` json
{
  "apa102": {
    "led": {
      "datapin": 40,
      "clockpin": 39,
      "count": 1,
      "brightness": "30",
      "value": "x203050"
    }
  }
}
```
