## The SSD1309 based display

There are 2.42 inch OLED display module on the market that can be used with HomeDing by using the SSD1306 compatibility mode.

It offers a 128x64 resolution and supports SPI and I2C mode interfaces.

It should be powered by 5V while the I2C signals are using 3.3V max. 

## Enable I2C mode

To enable the I2C mode (preferred Interface) you may have to solder the three resistors R3 R4 R5.

As for I2C communication, it is necessary to move the resistor on R4 to R3, and R5 is soldered with 0 ohm resistor.

The I2C address is 0x3C / 60.

Please have a look into the manual. 

## Wiring

| Connector | Feature        |               |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| GND       | power ground   | GND           |
| VCC       | power positive | 5.0 V         |
| SCL       | clock wire     | I2C-SCL (D1)  |
| SDA       | data wire      | I2C-SDA (D2)  |
| RES       | reset wire     | resetpin (D0) |
| DC        | data/command   | unused        |
| CS        | chip selection | unused        |
