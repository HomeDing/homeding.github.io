This display implementation features supported by this adapter are:

* 128\*64 or 128\*32 display resolutions
* Text output in the font sizes 10,16 and 24 px.
* Binary output shown as a filled or empty circle

The DisplaySH1106Element and the DisplayAdapterSH1106 class work together to enable using OLED displays based on the SH1106 chips as a local display.

The `DisplayElement` implements the configuration that specifies the hardware related parameters by using the configuration from the configuration file.

The `DisplayAdapter` class implements the communication with the chip that is integrated into the OLED display and connected through the I2C bus by using the Arduino library `ESP8266 and ESP32 Oled Driver for SSD1306 display` that can be installed using the Arduino Library Manager or can be downloaded from
<https://github.com/squix78/esp8266-oled-ssd1306>.

To show some output on the display use the [DisplayText Element](/elements/displaytext.md)
and the [DisplayDot Element](/elements/displaydot.md)


## Web UI for the DisplaySH1106 Element

There is a dedicated card for this element available that will be used for the web server config and landing pages:

![sh1106 Web UI](/elements/sh1106ui.png)

This card shows the current output that can also be seen on the local attached display. It is updated every time the status of the device is polled by the page.


## Element Configuration

The following properties are available for configuration of the element:

<object data="/sh1106.svg?lcd" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

**address** the address of the display on the I2C bus. Defaults to 0x3C.

**resetpin** optional the display reset can be triggered using a GPIO pin.

**height** height of the display in pixel. Defaults to 64.

The initialization of the I2C bus uses the SDA and SCL pins defined in the device configuration.


### Configuration Example


```json
{
  "displaysh1106": {
    "0": {
      "height": 32
    }
  }
}
```


## Element State

The following properties are available with the current values at runtime:

**active** - Is set to true when the element is active.


### Example State

```json
{
  "displaysh1106/0": {
    "active":"true"
  }
}
```
