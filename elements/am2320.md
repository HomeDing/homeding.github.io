description: Support of the AM2320 air temperature and humidity sensor chips in i2c mode.
excerpt: >
  The AM2320Element allows retrieving temperature and humidity values 
  and creates actions when new values are available.
---

The AM2320 sensor was created to be a drop-in replacement for the DHT22 but also support the i2c interface.

## OneWire or i2c Interface

The AM2320 sensor was created to be a drop-in replacement for the DHT22 but also support the i2c interface. There is a good article on comparing these two interfces:
See <https://learn.adafruit.com/modern-replacements-for-dht11-dht22-sensors>
for the advantage of i2c over DHT22 Wire signals.

When using the OneWire mode it is important to set pin 3 and 4 to permanent GND level. You can use the DHTElement to implement reading the temperature and humidity values as it supports the OneWire .

When using the i2c mode pin 3 is used for GND and pin 4 is used for the i2c-clk signal.

When using the i2c based communication the device may not respond at the first request
as it stays in an deactivated mode and must be waked up using a i2c read request without data.

The WireUtils do this when checking for a device to exist on a given address.


## Web UI for the DHT Element

There is a dedicated card for sensors supporting temperature and humidity that shows the actual values.

## Using the AM2320 Element

The DHT Element is not part of the core set of elements
because it is not used very frequently.
It can be registered and added to the firmware by including the definition of
HOMEDING_INCLUDE_AM2320 in the sketch:

'''CPP
# define HOMEDING_INCLUDE_AM2320
'''

## Element Configuration

The following properties are available for configuration of the element:

> **address** - The i2c address of the sensor. The default value is 0x40.
>
> **onTemperature** - These actions are emitted by the element when the temperature gets a new value. The action will not be sent when reading the sensor values that stay the same.
>
> **onHumidity** - These actions are emitted by the element when the humidity gets a new value. The action will not be sent when reading ne sensor values that stay the same.

### Configuration Example

``` json
{
  "am2320": {
    "s": {
      "title": "am2320-i2c",
      "description": "Temperature and Humidity sensor",
      "readtime": "30s",
      "onhumidity": "displaytext/h?value=$v",
      "ontemperature": "displaytext/t?value=$v"
    }
  }
}
```

## Element State

The following properties are available with the current values at runtime

> **active** - Is set to true when the element is active.
>
> **temperature** - The last read temperature value from the sensor.
>
> **humidity** - The last read humidity value from the sensor.


### Example State

``` json
{
  "am2320/s": {
    "active":"true",
    "temperature":"27.30",
    "humidity":"50.50"
  }
}
```
