:::excerpt default
The TM1637 is a chip that allows using 7-segment displays up to 6 digits and supports a matrix of momentary buttons for input.

![TM1637 based display](/elements/tm1637.jpg)

There are many different TM1637 based displays on the market and some also include input. This Element supports displays with 4-digits that can display time as it has colon leds in the middle. The decimal dots (when existing) are not wired and cannot be used.

## Element Configuration

The following properties are available for configuration of the element.

<object data="/element.svg?tm1637" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

**value** - The displayed value.
  This can be used to initialize the display until a valid value is passed by a value-action.

**brightness** - The brightness factor can be used to dim the light in general. The brightness value must be in the range 0..8. The default is 2.

**clockpin** - Specifies the output pin that is used for the clock signal to the chip.

**datapin** - Specifies the output pin that is used for the data signal to the chip.

**enabled** - to enable / disable the light without loosing the current value and brightness.


### Configuration Example

``` json
{
  "tm1637": {
    "0": {
      "title": "Time Display",
      "clockpin": "D6",
      "datapin": "D7",
      "brightness": "4",
      "value": "--:--"
    }
  }
}
```

## Element State

The following properties are available with the current values at runtime

**active** - Is set to true when the element is active.

**value** - Current output value of the element.


### Example State

The internal value can be seen in the rotary state but should not directly be used as a value.

``` json
{
  "my9291/0": {
    "active": "true",
    "value": "11:55"
  }
}
```


## Implementation hints

The TM1637 is controlled using a clock and a data signal. The protocol is similar to I2C protocol. The TM1637 cannot be part of the I2C bus but always needs a one-to-one connectivity.

The protocol implementation is present in the tm1637.h file and supports only displaying 4 digits and the colon right now.
