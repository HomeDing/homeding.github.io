There is a specific protocol required for this chip that packs 3 * 8 bits for red, green and blue into 4 bytes per pixel.
Some information is sent twice in these 4 byes.

The 4 bytes per pixel are transferred in series over the data line in the interval defined by the clock line.
There is no strict frequency required and implementation is not very complex to be implemented.

When using multiple chips chained up in a row every chip can drive a whole RGB LED strip. 


## Web UI for the P9813 Element

The [Neo Element](/elements/neo.md) has a similar feature to chain RGB LEDs. However they are controlled by a different protocol.
Both elements can be controlled by the same Web UI.
