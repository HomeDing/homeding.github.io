# BME680 Element

<div class="excerpt">
  <img src="/i/bme680.svg">
  <p>The BME680Element implements reading the 4 sensor values from a BME680 environment air sensor chip.
  <br/>This sensor can measure temperature, humidity, air pressure and an air resistance.</p>
</div>

The Element implementation uses the AdaFruit bme680 sensor library that needs to be installed to compile for a device that can use this sensor module and
uses the I2C bus for connection.

To make it available for configuration it needs to be included into the compilation by activating it using the macro

```CPP
#define HOMEDING_INCLUDE_BME680
```

Look into the full example source code for details.
After activating the Element and library consumes about 11.5 kByte additional programming memory.

## Sensor Connectivity

The sensor chip uses a 3.3 V Supply voltage on VCC and GND and needs to be connected to the SDA and SCL line of the I2C bus.
The I2C pins are configured using the properties of the [device element](/elements/device.md) and the I2C bus is normally chared by multiple elements e.g. sensors.

```JSON
{
  "device": {
    "0": {
      "i2c-scl": "D1",
      "i2c-sda": "D2"
    }
  }
}
```

The I2C address of the sensor is 0x77 = 119 by default and is configured using the element configuration.
The chip offers the possibility using an alternate address. Please refer to the documentation of your sensor board.

## Properties

These properties can be configured:

**readTime** Time between 2 probes from the sensor are fetched. The default value is 1 minute.

**address** The I2C Address of the sensor. The default value is 0x77.

### Example configuration

```JSON
{
  "bme680": {
    "bd": {
      "readtime": "10s",
      "ontemperature": "device/0?log=temp=$v",
      "onhumidity": "device/0?log=humidity=$v",
      "onpressure": "device/0?log=pressure=$v",
      "ongas": "device/0?log=gas=$v"
    }
  }
}
```


## Outbound Actions

The actions emitted by the BME680 Element has read some new data (with changed value) from the sensor.

**onTemperature** these actions are send when a new temperature value has beed read. The value given in the actions is actual temperature in Celcius.

**onHumidity** these actions are send when a new temperature value has beed read. The value given in the actions is actual Humidity in percentage.

**onPressure** these actions are send when a new pressure value has beed read. The value given in the actions is actual pressure in hPA.

**onGas** these actions are send when a new gas resistance value has beed read. The value given in the actions is actual gas resistance value in kOhm.

## State

```JSON
{
  "bme680/0": {
    "active":"true",
    "temperature":"21.21",
    "humidity":"43.48",
    "pressure":"99784",
    "gas":"72724"
  }
}
```
