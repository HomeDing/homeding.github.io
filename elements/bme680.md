# BME680 Element

<div class="excerpt">
  <img src="/i/bme680.svg">
  <p>The BME680Element implements reading the 4 sensor values from a BME680 sensor chip.
This sensor can measure temperature, humidity, air pressure and an air resistance.</p>
</div>

The Element implementation uses the AdaFruit bme680 sensor library that needs to be installed to compile for a device that can use this sensor module and
uses the I2C bus for connection.

To make it available for configuration it needs to be included into the compilation by activating it using the macro

```CPP
#define HOMEDING_INCLUDE_BME680
```

Look into the full example source code for details.
After activating the Element and library consumes about 11.5 kByte programming memory.


## Properties

These properties can be configured.

**readTime** Time between 2 probes from the sensor are fetched. The default value is 1 minute.

**address** The I2C Address of the sensor. The default value is 0x77.


## Outbound Actions

The actions emitted by the BME680 Element has read some new data (with changed value) from the sensor.

**onTemperature** these actions are send when a new temperature value has beed read. The value given in the actions is actual temperature in Celcius.

**onHumidity** these actions are send when a new temperature value has beed read. The value given in the actions is actual Humidity in percentage.

**onPressure** these actions are send when a new pressure value has beed read. The value given in the actions is actual pressure in hPA.

**onGas** these actions are send when a new gas resistance value has beed read. The value given in the actions is actual gas resistance value in kOhm.

## State

```JSON
{
  "bme680/0": {
    "active":"true",
    "temperature":"21.21",
    "humidity":"43.48",
    "pressure":"99784",
    "gas":"72724"
  }
}
```
