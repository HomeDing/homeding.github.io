excerpt: >
  The SI47xx is a series of radio chip from SiliconSilicon Labs, now Skyworks for receiving and transmitting
  FM stereo radio signals and other Bands.
---

The SI47xx radio chips are available in several variants.
The following variants are supported (and where tested) with the [Radio Library]:

* SI4721
* SI4730

It supports the following features:


## SI4721 Module from sparkfun

The si4721 radio chip was tested and adopted using the board from sparkfun you can find here:
<https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15853>.

This chip also supports sending FM signals, there is a special example 'TransmitSI4721.ino' to show this functionality.
in the radio library but is not supported by the [Radio Element].

## SI4730 Module NE928

The NE928 Module is available with different SI47xx chips variants.
This one is mounted with a si4730 version.

The pins assignment of the module is:

With some capacitors for the audio output and vcc and pull up resistors
for the I2C bus it can be controlled using the Radio Library and the [Radio Element].
