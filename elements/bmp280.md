excerpt: >
  The BMP280 Element supports the BMP280 sensor chips for air temperature and air absolute barometric pressure.
---

Bosch is developing advanced integrated environmental chips sind several years. Some of them are available on breakout boards and can easily be used together with the ESP CPU chips.

* [BMP280](/elements/bmp280.md) (temp and pressure) in 2012
* BME280 (temp, humidity and pressure) in 2013
* [BME680](/elements/bme680.md) (temp, humidity, pressure and volatile organic gas) in 2015

The have similar but not identical interfaces so each needs a special library and element to be used in the HomeDing library.

For BMP280 and BME680 no external library is required.


## Interface 

The physical communication is done via the I2C bus to read raw data values 
as well as some correction factors to calculate the temperature in celsius and pressure in pascal

This sensor element uses the base functionality of the [sensor class](/elements/sensors.md) to implement timing of taking probes and uses the WireUtil class for I2C data communication.

The calculation procedures are documented in the datasheet and taken unchanged into the BMP280Element implementation. 

The sensor is very similar to the [BME680 Sensor](/elements/bme680.md) that offers 2 more sensor values.


<!-- ## Web UI for the BMP280 Element

There is a dedicated card for this element available that shows the actual temperature and pressure.

## Using the BMP280 Element

The BMP280 Element is not part of the core set of elements but it can be added to the sketch and firmware by defining the macro `HOMEDING_INCLUDE_BMP280`.
This adds about 2100 bytes to the firmware but doesn't need any external library.

``` cpp
// Use some more optional Elements.
#define HOMEDING_INCLUDE_BMP280
```

The Sensor recipe shows how to configure a sensor device and log an actual value to get insight on passed values using a graphical output.

A complete story about using sensors with the HomeDing library is available here:
[Air Quality Monitoring Story](/stories/story-airquality.md)


## Connecting a Sensor

The BMP280 sensor must be connected to the common i2c bus and needs 3.3V power supply.

Using the default I2C bus pins:

| Signal                               | ESP8266   | ESP32 | Sensor  | Description                     |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | ----- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| <span class="gpio black">GND</span>  | GND       | GND   | GND     | Ground for I2C and Power Supply |
| <span class="gpio red">VCC</span>    | 3.3v      | 3.3v  | VCC/VDD | Power Supply                    |
| <span class="gpio blue">SDA</span>   | GPIO4(D2) | IO21  | SDA     | I2C Data Signal                 |
| <span class="gpio yellow">SCL</span> | GPIO5(D1) | IO22  | SCL     | I2C Clock Signal                |

The common i2c bus is configured in the [device element](/elements/device.md).
For more details on using the i2c bus and specifying pins see [I2C bus](/dev/i2c.md).


## Element Configuration

<object data="/element.svg?bmp280" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

The following properties are available for configuration of the element:

> **address** -- The I2C Address of the sensor. The default value is 0x76.
>
> **onTemperature** -- These actions are send when a new temperature value has been read. The value given in the actions is actual temperature in Celcius.
>
> **onPressure** -- These actions are send when a new pressure value has been read. The value given in the actions is actual pressure in hPA.

### Example configuration

``` json
{
  "bmp280": {
    "tp": {
      "address": "0x77",
      "readTime": "30s",
      "resendTime": "2m",
      "onTemperature": "device/0?log=temp=$v",
      "onPressure": "device/0?log=pressure=$v"
    }
  }
}
```

## State

``` json
{
  "bmp280/tp": {
    "active":"true",
    "temperature":"21.21",
    "pressure":"99784"
  }
}
```
