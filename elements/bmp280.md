# Sensor BMP280 

::: excerpt sensor
The BMP280 is a combination of a temperature and absolute barometric pressure sensor.
:::

The sensor must be connected to the common i2c bus that is configured in the [device element](/elements/device.md).

This sensor element uses the base functionality of the [sensor class](/elements/sensor.md) to implement timing of taking probes.

The sensor is very similar to the [BME680 Sensor](/elements/bme680.md) that offers 2 more sensor values.


## Web UI for the BMP280 Element

There is a dedicated card for this element available that shows the actual temperature and pressure.

## Using the BMP280 Element

The BMP280 Element is not part of the core set of elements but it can be added to the sketch and firmware by defining the macro `HOMEDING_INCLUDE_BMP280`. This adds about 2100 bytes to the firmware.

```CPP
// Use some more optional Elements.
#define HOMEDING_INCLUDE_BMP280
```

There is no need to install a library to use this element.

The Sensor recipe shows how to configure a sensor device and log an actual value to get insight on passed values using a graphical output.


## Connecting a Sensor

The BMP280 sensor must be connected to the common i2c bus and needs 3.3V power supply.

    ESP8266 board     BMP280
    GND ------------- GND
    3.3v ------------ VCC
    I2C-SCL --------- SCL
    I2C-SDA --------- SDA
    
The common i2c bus is configured in the [device element](/elements/device.md).


## Element Configuration

The following properties are available for configuration of the element:

**address** The I2C Address of the sensor. The default value is 0x76.

**readTime** Time between 2 probes from the sensor are fetched. The default value is 1 minute.

**resendTime** - The current values of the probe are resent after this specified time even when not changing.


### Example configuration

```JSON
{
  "bmp280": {
    "tp": {
      "readtime": "30s",
      "resendTime": "2m",
      "ontemperature": "device/0?log=temp=$v",
      "onpressure": "device/0?log=pressure=$v"
    }
  }
}
```


## Outbound Actions

The actions emitted by the BMP280 Element has read some new data (with changed value) from the sensor.

**onTemperature** these actions are send when a new temperature value has beed read. The value given in the actions is actual temperature in Celcius.

**onPressure** these actions are send when a new pressure value has beed read. The value given in the actions is actual pressure in hPA.


## State

```JSON
{
  "bmp280/tp": {
    "active":"true",
    "temperature":"21.21",
    "pressure":"99784"
  }
}
```
