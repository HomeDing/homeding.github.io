# Sensor BMP280 

:::excerpt bmp280
The BMP280 is a combination of a temperature and absolute barometric pressure sensor.
:::

Bosch is developing advanced integrated environmental chips sind several years. Some of them are available on breakout boards and can easily be used together with the ESP CPU chips.

* [BMP280](/elements/bmp280.md) (temp and pressure) in 2012
* BME280 (temp, humidity and pressure) in 2013
* [BME680](/elements/bme680.md) (temp, humidity, pressure and volatile organic gas) in 2015

The have similar but not identical interfaces so each needs a special library and element to be used in the HomeDing library.

For BMP280 and BME680 no external library is required.


## Interface 

The physical communication is done via the I2C bus to read raw data values 
as well as some correction factors to calculate the temperature in celsius and pressure in pascal

This sensor element uses the base functionality of the [sensor class](/elements/sensors.md) to implement timing of taking probes and uses the WireUtil class for I2C data communication.

The calculation procedures are documented in the datasheet and taken unchanged into the BMP280Element implementation. 

The sensor is very similar to the [BME680 Sensor](/elements/bme680.md) that offers 2 more sensor values.


<!-- ## Web UI for the BMP280 Element

There is a dedicated card for this element available that shows the actual temperature and pressure.

## Using the BMP280 Element

The BMP280 Element is not part of the core set of elements but it can be added to the sketch and firmware by defining the macro `HOMEDING_INCLUDE_BMP280`.
This adds about 2100 bytes to the firmware but doesn't need any external library.

```cpp
// Use some more optional Elements.
#define HOMEDING_INCLUDE_BMP280
```

The Sensor recipe shows how to configure a sensor device and log an actual value to get insight on passed values using a graphical output.

A complete story about using sensors with the HomeDing library is available here:
[Air Quality Monitoring Story](/stories/story-airquality.md)


## Connecting a Sensor

The BMP280 sensor must be connected to the common i2c bus and needs 3.3V power supply.

    ESP8266 board     BMP280
    GND ------------- GND
    3.3v ------------ VCC
    I2C-SCL --------- SCL
    I2C-SDA --------- SDA
    
The common i2c bus is configured in the [device element](/elements/device.md).


## Element Configuration

<object data="/element.svg?bmp280" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

The following properties are available for configuration of the element:

**address** The I2C Address of the sensor. The default value is 0x76.

**readTime** Time between 2 probes from the sensor are fetched. The default value is 1 minute.

**resendTime** - The current values of the probe are resent after this specified time even when not changing.


### Example configuration

```json
{
  "bmp280": {
    "tp": {
      "readTime": "30s",
      "resendTime": "2m",
      "onTemperature": "device/0?log=temp=$v",
      "onPressure": "device/0?log=pressure=$v"
    }
  }
}
```


## Outbound Actions

The actions emitted by the BMP280 Element has read some new data (with changed value) from the sensor.

**onTemperature** these actions are send when a new temperature value has beed read. The value given in the actions is actual temperature in Celcius.

**onPressure** these actions are send when a new pressure value has beed read. The value given in the actions is actual pressure in hPA.


## State

```json
{
  "bmp280/tp": {
    "active":"true",
    "temperature":"21.21",
    "pressure":"99784"
  }
}
```
