description: Using OLED pixel based display with a SH1106 controller chip.
excerpt: >
  The DisplaySH1106 Element allows connecting a pixel based OLED display based on a SH1106 chip.
layout: "page.njk"
---

This OLED displays offer a mono color (e.g. white on black) output with various resolutions and
can be addressed using the [Wire / I2C](/dev/i2c.md) or the [SPI](/dev/spi.md) protocol.

The chip supports a resolution up to 132 \* 64 pixels.
Some available displays only use a portion of the maximum display size. Some displays emit white, blue or yellow color on a pixel cannot be changed.

The implementation is done with the help of the GFX library for Arduino.

## Configuration

The displays are configured using the following parameters. Some displays will not support all functionality.

**width** - The width of the display either characters or pixels.

**height** - The height of the display either characters or pixels.

**rotation** - Some displays can be rotated. The rotation of the display is given by values of 0, 90, 180 or 270.

**page** -- The logical page that is displayed.

**busmode** -- This parameter specifies the bus type that is used to connect the display. Available interfaces are `i2c` or `spi`.

When connected using the [i2c bus](/dev/i2c.md) the SDA and SCL pins defined in the
[device](/elements/device.md) configuration are used and following parameters must be set:

**address** - The i2c address of the display when using the i2c bus for connecting the display.
By setting this parameter some display implementation will attach to the i2c bus otherwise to the SPI bus.

**busspeed** -- The bus speed used for the display can be specified up to 400KHz.

**brightness** -- The  displays an be adjusted in brightness / contrast by specifying a value using the brightness event in a range of 0 to 100. This has a limited range (limited by the chip).


### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "displaysh1106": {
    "0": {
      "title": "display",
      "description": "local display",
      "width": "128",
      "height": "64",
      "busmode": "i2c",
      "address": "0x3C",
      "busspeed": "1000000",
      "brightness": "50",
      "page": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

## Web UI for the Display Element

![sh1106 Web UI](/elements/display/sh1106ui.png)

This card shows the current output page that can also be seen on the local attached display.
It is updated every time the status of the device is polled by the page.

## Events

**brightness** - Some displays an be adjusted in brightness or contrast by specifying a value using the brightness event in a range of 0 tp 100.

**page** -

**addpage** -

**clear** -


## Actions

**onpage** -

## Element State

The following properties are available with the current values at runtime:

**active** - Is set to true when the element is active.


### Example State

``` json
{
  "displaysh1106/0": {
    "active": "true",
    "brightness": "43",
    "page": "1"
  }
}
```
