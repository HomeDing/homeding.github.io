description: Using OLED pixel based display with a SH1106 controller chip.
excerpt: >
  The DisplaySH1106 Element allows connecting a pixel based OLED display based on a SH1106 chip.
---

This OLED displays offer a mono color (e.g. white on black) output with various resolutions and
can be addressed using the [Wire / I2C](/dev/i2c.md) or the [SPI](/dev/spi.md) protocol.

The chip supports a resolution up to 132 \* 64 pixels.
Some available displays only use a portion of the maximum display size. Some displays emit white, blue or yellow color on a pixel cannot be changed.

The implementation is done with the help of the GFX library for Arduino.


## Display Configuration

The display is configured using the following parameters:

**width** - The width of the display either characters or pixels.

**height** - The height of the display either characters or pixels.

**rotation** - Some displays can be rotated. The rotation of the display is given by values of 0, 90, 180 or 270.

**page** -- The logical page that is displayed.

**brightness** -- The displays an be adjusted in brightness / contrast by specifying a value using the brightness event
in a range of 0 to 100.  This has a limited range (limited by the chip).

**busmode** -- This parameter specifies the bus type. Default is `i2c`.


### I2C Configuration Example

The SH1106 based displays can be connected to the SDA and SCL pins of the [i2c bus](/dev/i2c.md) that is configured
in the [device](/elements/device.md):

**busmode** -- This parameter specifies the bus type and must be specified as `i2c`.

**address** - The i2c address of the display must be specified. Typical values are `0x3C` and `0x3D`.

**busspeed** -- The bus speed used for the display can be specified up to 400KHz.


```json
{
  "device": {
    "0": {
      ...
      "I2C-SDA": "D2",
      "I2C-SCL": "D1"
    }
  },
  "displaysh1106": {
    "0": {
      "title": "display",
      "description": "local display",
      "width": "128",
      "height": "64",
      "busmode": "i2c",
      "address": "0x3C",
      "busspeed": "400000",
      "brightness": "50",
      "page": "1"
    }
  }
}
```


<!-- ### SPI Configuration Example

The SH1106 based displays can be connected to the [SPI bus](/dev/spi.md).
This must must be defined in the device configuration and the display configuration:

**busmode** -- This parameter specifies the bus type and must be specified as that is used to connect the display. Available interfaces are `i2c` or `spi`.

 ## Web UI for the Display Element

![sh1106 Web UI](/elements/display/sh1106ui.png)

This card shows the current output page that can also be seen on the local attached display.
It is updated every time the status of the device is polled by the page.

## Actions

**onpage** -

## Element State

The following properties are available with the current values at runtime:

**active** - Is set to true when the element is active.


### Example State

``` json
{
  "displaysh1106/0": {
    "active": "true",
    "brightness": "43",
    "page": "1"
  }
}
```
