The ST7701 chip supports the 16-bit graphics display bus from the esp32-s3 processor to transfer in-memory graphics data to the display and uses the SPI bus for configuration.

It is used in the [Panel ESP32-4848S040](/boards/esp32s3/panel-4848S040.md).


## Display Brightness Control

TFT displays need a background lightning that is controlled by a GPIO pin configured in
the parameter `lightpin`.
The `brightness` can be adjusted from 0 to 100.


## Rotating the Display

The Display driver may be used in different scenarios with different rotations. The rotation `0` is defined by the default
implementation of the display hardware and may be portrait or landscape. The rotation can be changed to 0, 90, 180 or 270.
