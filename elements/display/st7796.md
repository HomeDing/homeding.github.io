This display uses the **GFX Library for Arduino**. It must be installed using the Arduino Library Manager.


**brightness** -- set the brightness of the background light in the range 0...100

From my testings a value of 20 is usable in low light situations and a value of 80 fits to normal indoor situations.

Using the builtin LDR the light situation of the environment can be detected to adjust the brightness.

LDR 0 => 80
LDR 200 => 20

"mapInMin": "0", "mapOutMin" : "80",
"mapInMax": "200", "mapOutMin" : "20",


lightpin // the pin used for PWM based backlight control
