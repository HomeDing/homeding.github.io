            After a reboot or when powering up the network connection needs to be established or configured and the operating mode is chosen based on counting reset cycles.

          </div>
        
        <p>Many things may happen when a device is staring and even a given configuration can fail.
The startup sequence of a device actually is the critical part of the implementation
to avoid loosing a device in a unrecoverable state.</p>
<h2>The Normal Startup</h2>
<p>In a full configured device the startup is using the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The root file system is initialized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The env.json configuration file is used to create the device specific elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The config.json configuration file is used to create the application specific elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The elements marked with startup=sys are started. This usually includes the display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some Greeting information is given to the display and Serial logging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network connection is started (see below)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The elements marked with startup=net are started. This usually includes most of the elements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When there is a time giving element present:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network time is retrieved.</li>
<li>The elements marked with startup=time are started when a valid time is given. This includes e.g. alarm elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the “normal” operation mode is reached, the loop() function is called on the elements one-by-one and upcomming actions are dispatched to their target element.</p>
<p>[ ] 5 minutes startup timeout to restart
[ ] 60 seconds runtime to set the reset counter to 0</p>
<p>There are several operating modes implemented that help in network and device configurations and allow even
starting a device without or with a wrong configuration. This is based on the available network configuration
and a counter of the latest reset cycles.</p>
<p>The network configuration is given by the <a href="/dev/wifimanager.htm">WiFi Manager</a>.</p>
<p>The reset counter is incremented immediately after the restart of the device and is set to the value 0
after successfully running a device for at least 60 seconds.</p>
<p>A reset can be enforced by powering off and on the device or by using the <code>RST</code> / <code>EN</code> button
that is available on many boards.</p>
<p>Sometimes the wireless network is not available and a configured network connection can not be
established. In this case the device will restart after 5 minutes with a reset
counter set to 0. This allows starting in a normal operation mode after a network dropout.</p>
<h2>Captive Mode</h2>
<p>This mode is automatically chosen when no network configuration is given or after several resets
in a row.</p>
<p>In this operating mode an access point is created with a name <code>HomeDing-xxxxxx</code> using the last 6
digits of the MAC adddress of the board. Any client can connect to this access point and can
access the WiFi Setup Dialog of the <a href="/dev/wifimanager.htm">WiFi Manager</a>.</p>
<p>In this mode NO configured element will be activated.</p>
<p>Using the WiFi Setup Dialog the network connection details can configured and persisted on the
board.</p>
<p>The reset counter is always set to 0 after successfully running the captive mode
or by updating a new network connectivity.</p>
<h2>Normal Run Mode</h2>
<p>This mode is enabled when the reset counter has the value 1.</p>
<p>This is the regular working mode for a configured device.</p>
<ul>
<li>All configured Elements created.</li>
<li>The last <a href="/elements/state.htm">state information of elements</a> is given to the elements.</li>
<li>The System Elements are started.</li>
<li>When network is available the Elements requiring a Network are started.</li>
<li>When a current time is available the Elements requiring a current time are started.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the <code>secure</code> property is set in the device configuration some
device configuration functionality is disabled protect.</p>
<h2>Unsecure Run Mode</h2>
<p>This mode is enabled when the reset counter has the value 2.  It can be enabled by resetting or
re-powering the device twice within 60 seconds. This mode and behaves exactly like the Normal
Run Mode in the non-secure mode.</p>
<p>This mode is available for enabling OTA updates on devices with the <code>secure</code> property is set in
the device configuration.</p>
<h2>Bare Run Mode</h2>
<p>This mode is enabled when the reset counter has the value 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>The network configuration is used for network connectivity.</li>
<li>Only a [Device element] and an [OTA Element] is created without loading any configuration
file.</li>
</ul>
<p>This results in a device using a generic name like <code>ESP-xxxxxx</code> or <code>ESP32-xxxxxx</code>. on the local
network.</p>
<p>The Web Server files can be uploaded and the device can be configured through uploaded
configuration files or the integrated IDE functionality.</p>
<h2>Enforced Captive Mode</h2>
<p>This mode is enabled when the reset counter has the value 4 or greater. The device runs the
Captive mode described above.</p>
<p>When the Captive mode is unused for 5 minutes or ended by configuring a new network connectivity
the reset counter is set to 0 and a restart is executed.</p>
<h2>Startup logging output</h2>
<p>The following samples will show you how the startup sequence is shown in the log and explains the output in detail.</p>
<h3>Device Startup on first time</h3>
<p>After uploading the HomeDing firmware the very first time the log output will show the following
messages:</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">00:00:06 >Device DevDing starting...
00:00:06 >formatting...
00:00:06 >setup done
00:00:06 >Captive Mode: HomeDing123A45</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Device ____ starting...</code> messages is showing the name of the sketch (example) that is used.</p>
<p>The <code>formatting...</code> message is shown because the filesystem will be created during this very
first start sequence.</p>
<p>The <code>setup done</code> messages is created at the end of the Arduino startup() function just before
the loop() will start.</p>
<p>The <code>Captive Mode: HomeDingNNNNNN</code> message is shown when an Access point is created with the given name
for starting a network configuration with the [WiFi Manager].</p>
<p>This sequence of messages will also happen when uploading the firmware with the <code>Erase All Flash Before Sketch Upload: Enabled</code> option.</p>
<h3>Device Startup without configuration</h3>
<p>When no network configuration is available the device will immediately start into the Captive mode.</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">00:00:06 >Device DevDing starting...
00:00:06 >setup done
00:00:06 >Captive Mode: HomeDing123A45</code></pre>
<p>After 5 minutes without using the captive mode the device will restart:</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">00:05:06 >no config.
00:05:06 >reboot...</code></pre>
<p>The <code>no config.</code> message is shown after 5 minutes without getting a network configuration.</p>
<p>The <code>reboot...</code> message is shown because a reboot was initiated.</p>
<h3>Network configuration</h3>
<p>In Captive mode, when a configuration is given using the [WiFi Manager] the following logs are
created:</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">00:02:39 >setup network ____
00:02:44 >ok. 
00:02:44 >reboot...</code></pre>
<p>The <code>setup network ____</code> message is shown when a new network configuration is received.</p>
<p>The <code>ok.</code> message is shown when the network connection was successful.</p>
<p>The <code>reboot...</code> message is shown because a reboot was initiated.</p>
<h3>Regular Startup Without Configuration</h3>
<p>The startup mesages on a regular boot when no configuration is available (or is not used in bare
mode) look like:</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">00:00:06 >Device DevDing starting...
00:00:06 >setup done
00:00:06 >HomeDing
00:00:06 >connect as 'esp32-123a45' to WiFI DEVNET...
00:00:12 >esp32-123a45 192.168.2.206
00:00:12 >connected to DEVNET (unsafe mode)
00:00:12 >start http://esp32-123a45/</code></pre>
<p><code>HomeDing</code> Greeting
This message is also shown on an attached and configured display.</p>
<p><code>connect as 'esp32-123a45' to WiFI DEVNET...</code> – devicename and network name used for connecting</p>
<p><code>esp32-123a45 192.168.2.206</code> - successful connected to the network with the devicename and IP address.
This message is also shown on an attached and configured display.</p>
<p><code>start http://esp32-123a45/</code></p>
<h3>Regular Startup</h3>
<p>The following startup mesages are created for a configured device (name=“hdboard”) and safemode
enabled.
They look similar to the messages written when no element configuration is given but the devicename is taken from the device Element.</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">00:11:09 >Device DevDing starting...
00:11:09 >setup done
00:11:09 >HomeDing 
00:11:09 >connect as 'hdboard' to WiFI DEVNET...
00:11:12 >hdboard 192.168.2.206
00:11:12 >connected to DEVNET (safe mode)
00:11:12 >start http://hdboard/</code></pre>
<p>see also: <a href="/dev/safemode.htm">Safe Mode</a></p>
<h3>2. reset in between 60 seconds</h3>
<p>When a second reset or reboot is executed without having 60 seconds of normal operating time
the device will start in unsafe mode and the connected message will look like:</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">00:15:22 >Device DevDing starting...
00:15:22 >setup done
00:15:22 >reset #2
00:15:22 >HomeDing 
00:15:22 >connect as 'hdboard' to WiFI DEVNET...
00:15:23 >hdboard 192.168.2.206
00:15:23 >connected to DEVNET (unsafe mode)
00:15:23 >start http://hdboard/</code></pre>
<p>The <code>reset #2</code> message shows the internal reset counter.</p>
<p>see also: <a href="/dev/safemode.htm">Safe Mode</a></p>
<h3>3. reset in between 60 seconds</h3>
<p>When a third reset or reboot is executed without having 60 seconds of normal operating time the
device will start in <strong>bare</strong> mode. In this mode the device will start using the network
configuration but no device configuration file will be used. The message sequence will look
like:</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">00:00:06 >Device DevDing starting...
00:00:06 >setup done
00:00:06 >reset #3
00:00:06 >HomeDing 
00:00:06 >connect as 'esp32-123a45' to WiFI DEVNET...
00:00:08 >esp32-123a45 192.168.2.206
00:00:08 >connected to DEVNET (unsafe mode)
00:00:08 >start http://esp32-123a45/</code></pre>
<p>The <code>reset #3</code> message shows the internal reset counter.</p>
<p>The same devicename is used that is used on booting without configuration. The IP address will
likely be the same.</p>
<h3>4. reset in between 60 seconds</h3>
<p>When a forth reset or reboot is executed without having 60 seconds of normal operating time the captive mode is started
without connecting the device to a local network.</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">00:00:06 >Device DevDing starting...
00:00:06 >setup done
00:00:06 >reset #4
00:00:06 >Captive Mode: HomeDing123A45</code></pre>
<p>The <code>reset #4</code> message shows the internal reset counter.</p>
<p>The reset counter is set to 0 after successfully running the captive mode
or after updating the network connectivity.</p>
