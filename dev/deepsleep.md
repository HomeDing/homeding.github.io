excerpt: >
  The deep sleep mode allows saving energy consumption by powering down the device for a defined time
  to support situations where "always on" is not possible.
---

In some use case there is not enough power available to run a device with a full web server
functionality enabled all day long. Using the deep sleep mode for inactive devices
enables devices to use batteries as a power source.

The deep sleep mode limits the availability to reach the device as the WiFi connection
that is consuming a lot of power also will be offline and the embedded web server of the device will not be reachable.

Examples:

* A button for a door bell should run for months / years but only needs to be active when a visitor come to the door.
* A temperature sensor on the outside is placed where no constant power is available
* Control that your plats have enough water.
* Windows must be monitored to be closed and you don't want to have wires all across the walls.

All of these use case not only must work they also must be reliable.

Handling low power situations successfully is a hard engineering job
and some microprocessors are especially made for this purpose.
The capabilities of the device and sensors also significantly impact on the demands placed on the power supply.

The ESP8266 chips are **not** made for these extremely low power use cases as the minimal current is about 20 to 40 ÂµA. Other processors use 20 nA, 1000 times less.

The ESP32 chips are using about 10 mA during deep sleep mode.

Using WiFi network for data transport has a lot of advantages but is not energy efficient. E.g. registering a device on a WiFi network requires some significant time and sending WiFi signals also require a minimum of power.

Other network technologies allow sending data without registration so there is less startup time.

## Hardware requirements for ESP8266

To make the deep sleep mode in the ESP8266 work 2 pins must be connected:

Pin <span class="gpio black">RST</span> and Pin <span class="gpio blue">GPIO16/D0</span>.

This allows to recall the halted CPU by the builtin timer.
To wake up after a deep sleep the sleep timer that is implemented in low-power hardware will pull GPIO16/D0 to GND for some time and this will trigger a reset of the processor.

This connection is not available on nodeMCU and many other boards and must be connected externally.

It is maybe required to add a additional 10k PullUp between SD0(MISO) and 3.3V in addition to the bridging of GPIO16/D0 and RST.

See <https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/6007>


## Reset after Deep Sleep

In the deep sleep mode most of the functionality is switched off and only some specific RTC memory areas
and a simple hardware based count-down timer are kept active. The ESP32 offers also a low power Processor that may run during deep sleep of the main processors.

Using the deep sleep mode requires at least the following configurations:

* how long the device can be set as rest.
* when to shut down
* when to wake up again


## Device configuration

To activate the deep sleep the deep sleep duration must be set in the [device element](/elements/device.md) using the `sleeptime` property and configure a duration.

``` json
{
  "device": {
    "0": {
      "sleeptime": 60,
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

There is a maximum time about 71 min. the sleep mode can be activated. The device will power up triggered by the timer
and will restart all elements.


## Restart after Deep Sleep Mode

When devices use the deep sleep mode it is critical to not loose time during execution as this time will cause power consumption.

Therefore a device restart after a deep sleep will ignore the `connecttime` device configuration and will start execution as soon as the network is connected. This results in an executing device after 1 to 3 seconds as there is no need to wait for the configuration button to be pressed.

It is not possible to exactly detect a reset that was caused by a wake-up from sleep mode as this is done ba setting a flag before entering the deep sleep mode in RTC memory. Resetting a device that is in deep sleep mode will probably
start without waiting for the `connecttime` to be over. A power-down, power-up cycle will however start with a full `connecttime`.

The Greeting Phase on the Board startup sequence is also skipped so reduced information is shown
in the log output.


## Trigger the deep sleep phase

To start the sleep mode th device must have finished executing.
Therefore a `sleep` action must be sent to the `device` element e.g.
after reading and logging a sensor value:

Example:

``` json
{
  "dht": {
    "0": {
      "ontemperature": "log/t?value=$v,device/0?sleep=true"
    }
  }
}
```


## Cancelling a deep sleep phase

The sleep mode can also be disabled completely by sending a `sleep` action with value 0 to the device element using:
<http://homeding/api/device/0?nosleep>.

This enables configuration and modification of the devices even when they are
configured for sleep mode and accessed remotely.


## Defer the start of the deep sleep phase

The real start of the sleep mode is not exactly given by the `sleep` action but is delayed
some cycles to give enough time to dispatch process results and finish any pending actions.

The board will give any existing element some `loop()` time to execute and when all elements are through the sleep mode will be started. Also some elements like the [Remote Element](/elements/remote.md) will need some time to finish.

A delay of starting the sleep mode will happen on the following conditions:

* A `sleep` action is passed to the board to be dispatched.
* When there was no wake-up from an previous sleep but any other reset reason. Tn this case the deep sleep phase
  will not started before waiting for 60 seconds.
* No action is pending to be executed.
* All elements got at least once the chance to act by calling the loop() function.
* When no element actively delays the sleep mode by calling `board->deferSleepMode()`.
* The `nosleep` action on the device was not called.


## Temporarily disable the deep sleep phase

The rules to defer the deep sleep mode allows configuring a device with the web ui when using the following sequence:

1. Reset the device using the RST button or by a power off on cycle.
   This will cause that the sleep mode will wait at least 60 seconds before getting started.
2. Open a browser to trigger the action to disable the sleep mode using the url
    <http://homeding/$board/device/0?nosleep>
3. Start the board or ide url of the device for working:
   * <http://homeding/board.htm>
   * <http://homeding/microide.htm>
4. To continue using the deep sleep reset the board again by the RST button or the reset function in the IDE.


## Logfile - first reboot

Here is a typical log output with some hints recorded after a hardware reset.

``` txt
00:00:00 sys:i Device starting...
00:00:04 sys:t connected.
00:00:11 dht/on:t getProbe()
00:00:11 root:i T:24.90
00:00:11 root:i H:70.00
00:00:11 device/0:i start sleep(true)
00:00:41 sys:i sleep...
```

* The first regular reset by Hardware reset button or by using the reboot service is starting the device.
* After ~4 seconds the device has a network connection.
* The device waits for end of 10 seconds to give the user the chance to start config mode.
* After ~11 seconds the sensor gets a probe and starts going for the sleep mode.
* The time between the initiation of the sleep by the sensor having a measurement
  is delayed for ~30 seconds before it is actually executed.
* After ~41 seconds the sleep mode is entered.

During the 30 seconds delayed time the web server is active so it is possible to send a request to the device
like `http://homeding/api/device/0?nosleep` to block any sleep mode from execution and to use the web UI for configuration until another reboot is initiated.


## Logfile - reboot from sleep mode

Here is a typical log output with some hints recorded after a wake-up reset from deep sleep mode.

``` txt
00:00:00 sys:i Device starting...
00:00:00 sys:i Reset from Deep Sleep mode.
00:00:02 sys:t connected.
00:00:03 dht/on:t getProbe()
00:00:03 root:i T:23.40
00:00:03 root:i H:72.10
00:00:03 device/0:i start sleep(true)
00:00:03 sys:t sleep...
```

In this case no waiting for config mode and no 30 seconds waiting before entering sleep mode is present.
Everything else woks exactly the same as before but the whole sequence is executed faster.


> **Important node**
>
> The implementation of the deep sleep mode uses a memory location in the RTC memory

> When a manual reset id given by pressing the RESET button the first reset is always interpreted as a return from deep sleep.
> To get into a full **hardware reset**

> * a second reset following quick after the first must be used
> * a power-down and power-up cycle must occur.
