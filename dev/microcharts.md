Some visuals on the board and index implementation are based on the [SFC](https://github.com/mathertel/sfc) and SVG
technology to visualize data.

SVG is not a pure graphic format that can be used for icons, it also offers a DOM and APIs on the elements that can be
used almost like HTML objects.

The micro-charts in the HomeDing UI are implemented within the [SFC](https://github.com/mathertel/sfc) project and can
be used for other projects as well.  The loader and component implementations of this library is not having any further
dependency and focuses in resulting low footprints for download.
