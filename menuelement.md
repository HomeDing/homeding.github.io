# Menu Element ???

DRAFT

The MenuElement allows controlling multiple value element using only one rotary encoder and one button and using a display to show the actual menu selection and value.

Some rotary encoders already have a built-in momentary button when pressing the knob down. The menu element is especially made for using these as input but an extra button works well also.
