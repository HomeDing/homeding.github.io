# Map to the embedded Web Site Pages

These UI pages are hosted on the device itself. They are implemented respecting the small available memory but provide some powerful functions to even configure and customise the device.

## Home Page

This landing page when the device is opened using the URL with the devicename.

It contains the links to the available functions and offers some insights to some technical runtime parameters.

## Dashboard

On this page every element is shown on a card and shows the actual runtime parameters like sensor values.

In the standard view the system related elements are not visualized. By using the [sys] button they can be shown as well.
