The recipes is a collection of configurations that can be used
with the standard set of elements included in the [Standard Example](/examples/standard.md).

They show how multiple elements can be combined to create functionality beyond using a single element.

## Combining Elements

* [Simple LED blink](/recipes/blink.md) - Using a timer and a digital output
* [Create Alarm actions](/recipes/alarm.md)
* [LED recipe](/recipes/led.md) - Using a button switch a digital output with a LED on and off.
* [LED Dimming recipe](/recipes/led.md) - Dimming a LED using 2 momentary buttons.
* [LED Rotary recipe](/recipes/ledrotary.md) - Dimming LED using a rotary encoder.
* [NTP Clock with OLED](/recipes/ntpclock.md) - Display the current time and date from the internet time service.
* [NTP Clock with TM1627](/recipes/ntpclock2.md) - Display the current time from the internet time service on a 4 digit display.
* [Control Brightness](/recipes/brightness.md) - Use an additional [value](/elements/value.md)
    and [State Element](/elements/state.md) to control the brightness of a display.
* [LDR switch](/recipes/ldrswitch.md) - use a LDR to create a touchless on/off switch.
* [Create plant watering](/recipes/water.md) - Use a timer and button to give water to plants.
* [Logic Elements](/recipes/logic.md) - Combine values with logical operators.
* [Use a timer for lights](/recipes/lighttimer.md)
* [Use a remote button](/recipes/remotebutton.md)
* [Use a remote display](/recipes/remotedisplay.md)
* [Use a servo](/recipes/servo.md)
* [Display temperature](/recipes/tempdisplay.md)


## Using Sensors

* [Logging Temperature Sensor](/recipes/templogger.md) - Use a DHT sensor and the log element to record values.
* [Soil Moisture Sensor](/recipes/capasoil.md) - Use a timer and button to give water to plants.

<!-- * Display temperature from local sensor -->
<!-- * [Display Time, temperature and humidity](/recipes/tempdisplay.md) -->

<!-- ## Combining Devices

* Display temperature on remote display 
* Switch a remote LED on and off -->
