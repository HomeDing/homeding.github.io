The recipes is a collection of configurations that can be used
with the standard set of elements included in the [Standard Example](/examples/standard.md).

They show how multiple elements can be combined to create functionality beyond using a single element.

## Combining Elements

### Light Examples

* [Simple LED blink](/recipes/blink.md) - Using a timer and a digital output
* [Create Alarm actions](/recipes/alarm.md)
* [LED recipe](/recipes/led.md) - Using a button switch a digital output with a LED on and off.
* [LED Dimming recipe](/recipes/led.md) - Dimming a LED using 2 momentary buttons.
* [LED Rotary recipe](/recipes/ledrotary.md) - Dimming LED using a rotary encoder.
* [Use a timer for lights](/recipes/lighttimer.md)

### Other Examples

* [NTP Clock with OLED](/recipes/ntpclock.md) - Display the current time and date from the internet time service.
* [NTP Clock with TM1627](/recipes/ntpclock2.md) - Display the current time from the internet time service on a 4 digit display.

* [LDR switch](/recipes/ldrswitch.md) - use a LDR to create a touchless on/off switch.
* [Create plant watering](/recipes/water.md) - Use a timer and button to give water to plants.
* [Logic Elements](/recipes/logic.md) - Combine values with logical operators.
* [Use a remote button](/recipes/remotebutton.md)
* [Use a remote display](/recipes/remotedisplay.md)
* [Use a servo](/recipes/servo.md)
* [Display temperature](/recipes/tempdisplay.md)


## Using Sensors

* [Logging Temperature Sensor](/recipes/templogger.md) - Use a DHT sensor and the log element to record values.
* [Soil Moisture Sensor](/recipes/capasoil.md) - Use a timer and button to give water to plants.

* [MQTT DHT Sensor](/recipes/mqttdht.md) - Use a DHT sensor to report temperature and humidity to a MQTT server.
