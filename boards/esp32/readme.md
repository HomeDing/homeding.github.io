  Links, material and tips for using ESP32 based boards with the HomeDing library.
---

The HomeDing library is compatible to the ESP32 Arduino environment.

Specific to ESP32 are the following features:

* Usually there are no other names for the GPIO pins and GPIO numbers from the processor descriptions are used.
* An exception is the [Arduino Nano ESP32](/boards/esp32s3/arduino-nano-esp32.md) having printed
  pin numbers that differ from the GPIO numbers.

* The [Touch Element](/elements/touch.md) allows using the ESP32 built-in touch features on the GPIO pins.
* The [MY9291 Element](/elements/light/my9291.md) only works with ESP8266 by the used library.

* The ESP32 uses partitions to structure the flash memory. The Arduino environment supports a fixed layout that cannot be changed easily.

## Auto Upload Probelms

Uploading a new firmware via the USB interface does not work fully automatically on some boards as expected.
This is caused by a timing problem with the EN signal (RST).

If you can upload by using the manual reset sequence (Press Boot, Press and release EN, Release Boot)
adding a 10ÂµF capacitor to EN and GND may help.
