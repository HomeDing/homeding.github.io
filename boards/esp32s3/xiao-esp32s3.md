excerpt: >
  The XIAO ESP32 S3 is a thumb-size board with external antenna designed for low power consumption.
---

The Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 board offers a Xtensa 32-bit LX7 dual-core processor, WiFi, Bluetooth LE 5.0
and lithium battery charging management in a thumb-sized compact design.
The antenna is connected using a IPEX connector.  
 
The small size of 21 * 17.5 mm and the design for low power makes this board ideal to be embedded in IoT devices.
