## I2C bus

The display touch controller is connected using the [i2c bus](/dev/i2c.md). The ESP32 pins in used are specified in the device
configuration.

## SPI bus

The display and the SD card are using the [SPI bus](/dev/spi.md). The ESP32 pins in used are specified in the device configuration.


## Display

The IPS LCD display is supporting a resolution of 480 * 480 pixels and 16-bit colors and is based on the ST7701 chip.

It is connected to the processor using the ESP32-S3 specific 16-bit data bus using DMA to transfer for pixel data and the SPI bus in
9-bit mode for commands and configuration.

The SPI bus is using the 9-bit data transfer can only be used for sending information. As the 9-bit mode is not supported by the
Arduino environment the spi bus configuration must be given on the display element.

The pins in use can be found in the env.json configuration.

It is supported by current version of the "GFX Library for Arduino".

Both communication mechanisms (9-bit SPI and 16-bit Panel) must be configured and the display must be initialized with the board
specific initialization sequence from the provided examples.

```cpp
// 9-bit mode SPI
bus = new Arduino_ESP32SPI(
    GFX_NOT_DEFINED /* DC */, 39 /* CS */, 48 /* SCK */, 47 /* MOSI */, GFX_NOT_DEFINED /* MISO */);

// panel (Hardware) specific
Arduino_ESP32RGBPanel *rgbpanel = new Arduino_ESP32RGBPanel(
    18 /* DE */, 17 /* VSYNC */, 16 /* HSYNC */, 21 /* PCLK */,
    4 /* R0 */, 5 /* R1 */, 6 /* R2 */, 7 /* R3 */, 15 /* R4 */,
    8 /* G0 */, 20 /* G1 */, 3 /* G2 */, 46 /* G3 */, 9 /* G4 */, 10 /* G5 */,
    11 /* B0 */, 12 /* B1 */, 13 /* B2 */, 14 /* B3 */, 0 /* B4 */,
    1 /* hsync_polarity */, 10 /* hsync_front_porch */, 8 /* hsync_pulse_width */, 50 /* hsync_back_porch */,
    1 /* vsync_polarity */, 10 /* vsync_front_porch */, 8 /* vsync_pulse_width */, 20 /* vsync_back_porch */);

// panel parameters & setup
gfx = new Arduino_RGB_Display(
    480 /* width */, 480 /* height */, rgbpanel, 0 /* rotation */, true /* auto_flush */,
    bus, GFX_NOT_DEFINED /* RST */, st7701_4848S040_init, sizeof(st7701_4848S040_init));
```

The init sequence can be found in the examples for this board or in the HomeDing Display implementation: <>

<!-- https://github.com/HomeDing/HomeDing/blob/master/src/displays/DisplayESP32PanelAdapter.h -->

## Touch Controller

This devices uses a GT911 display touch chip connected to he I2C bus. The [Display TouchGT911 Element](/elements/display/touchgt911.md)
can be used with address 0x5D.

The reset and interrupt pins are not connected.


## Relay control

The 1 to 3 relays in the device are located in the back part of the module and can be controlled using the GPIO 40, 2 and 1. The env.json configuration above has a [Digital Output Element](/elements/digitalout.md) for the relay # 1.


## Battery Connector

I have not yet found out how this can be used.

maybe: IP5306


## Speaker Connector

I have not yet found out how this can be used.
maybe: NS4168


## SW1

There is a hidden momentary button beside the USB Connector.

I have not yet found out how this is connected.


## USB-C Connector

This can be used for uploading new software and powering the device. There is a CH350
USB-to-Serial chip used for flashing the software so no direct connection using the internal USB
of the ESP32-S3.


## TF Card

The module has a SD card connector and SD cards can be inserted in the slot above the USB connector.

This enables using files on the sd card by configuring the [SD Element](/elements/sd.md) for
several use-cases. The specific configuration can be found above.

The Micro SD Card supports the SPI Mode using the following GPIOs:

| SD Pin | Description         | ESP32 Pin |
| ------ | ------------------- | --------- |
| 1      | not used            |           |
| 2      | Chip Select (CS)    | GPIO42    |
| 3      | SPI-MOSI (Data in)  | GPIO47    |
| 4      | VDD                 |           |
| 5      | SPI-CLK             | GPIO48    |
| 6      | GND                 |           |
| 7      | SPI-MISO (Data out) | GPIO41    |
| 8      | not used            |           |
