description: ESP32-C3 based board with a round LCD Touch Display
excerpt: >
  This board uses a ESP32-C3 processor and has a built-in 
  1.28 inch LCD Display, a Touch controller and Battery Management.
---

The [ESP32-C3 processor](index.md) is a single-core SoC based on the open-source 32-bit RISC-V
architecture.

The module is made by Shenzhen Jingcai Intelligent Co. <www.jczn1688.com> with the number
`ESP32-2424S012` using the ESP32-C3-MINI-1U module by espressif offering:

* 4 MB flash
* (15 GPIOs)
* USB-C direct connection


## Arduino Board Configuration

The Arduino Board Manager supports this board by installing the `esp32 by espressif` package.
It can be used with the following settings:

* Board: **ESP32C3 Dev Module**
* Upload Speed: 921600
* USB CDC On Boot: Enabled
* CPU Frequency: 160 MHz
* Flash Frequency: 80MHz
* Flash Mode: QIO
* Flash Size: 4MByte (32Mbit)
* Partition Scheme: Default 4MB with spiffs (1.2MB App/1.5MB SPIFFS)
* Core Debug Level: None
* Erase All Flash: Disabled
* JTAG Adapter: Integrated USB JTAG


## Device


## Display

The Display is based on the GC9A01 chip and connected via the standard SPI bus. The special pins
for the chip communication and the Backlight controlling pin are defined on the element.


So we can see that we have these pins in use:

GC9A01


      "spi-scl": "6",
      "spi-mosi": "7"

dc = 2
cs = 10
backlight = 3
