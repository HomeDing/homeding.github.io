tags: ["Board"]
excerpt: >
  This is an adapter board that can be used to flash ESP-12 modules before adding them to a device.
  This solution is especially helpful for creating devices that run on battery or low power conditions and therefore do not need USB chips.

Using ESP-12 modules instead of using full featured boards like [nodemcu](/boards/nodemcu.md)
is especially suitable for creating devices that run on battery or low power conditions and therefore
do not need USB chips.

When using this kind of adapter with a EPS-12 module the solution behaves like a regular [nodemcu](/boards/nodemcu.md)
board, same Flash size, same CPU etc.
