excerpt: >
  This board from WeMos has a OLED display on a ESP-12E module based ESP8266 board
  with a joystick input, LiIon Battery support and on/off switch.

This board is equipped with:

* ESP8266-12 module
* OLED display based on the SSD1306 chip
* A „joystick“ type of button that can be used as input and hardware reset.
* A standard 18650 li-ion battery holder attached to the back
* Charging chip for charging through the USB port
* A power switch that separates all power consumption from the battery

## Arduino Board Configuration

The Arduino Board Manager supports this board by installing the `esp8266 by ESP8266 Community` package.
It can be used with the following settings:

* Board: **NodeMCU (ESP-12E Module)**
* CPU Frequency: 80 MHz
* VTables: Flash
* C++ Exception: Disabled
* Stack Protection: Disabled
* SSL Support: AllSSL Ciphers (most compatible)
* MMU: 32kB cache + 32kB
* IRAM (balanced)* Upload Speed: 921600
* Non-32-Bit Access: Use pgm_read macros for IRAM/PROGMEM
* Flash Size: 4MByte (FS:2MB OTA:~1019kB)
* Builtin Led: 2+
* IwIP Variant: v2 Lower Memory
* Debug port: Serial
* Debug level: None
* Erase Flash: All Flash Contents on first upload, then Only Sketch
* Upload Speed: 921600

This setting is identical to the standard NodeMCU settongs. However the features on the board
are extended and not all signals are available to connectors.


## OLED Display

The display is using the OLED technology and the chip is attached using the internal I2C bus and
is supported by the SSD1306 Element and Display adapter.

The display resolution is 128x64 pixels.

The display can be used by configuring the [DisplaySSD1306 Element](/elements/display/ssd1306.md).

The full configuration is provided below.


## Joystick

The joystick button is connected to 4 input pins and to the reset pin as well this makes this
button almost useless for games and menu selection functionality because it will happen by
accident that the reset direction (move to the right) is activated.

| Joystick | Pin        |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Right    | Reset      |
| Left     | GPIO0(D3)  |
| Up       | GPIO12(D6) |
| Down     | GPIO13(D7) |
| Press    | GPIO14(D5) |


### Onboard LED

There is a green LED at GPIO16(D0).

The green LED at GPIO16(D0) only can be used when there is no need for [deep sleep](/dev/deepsleep.md) functionality
and only can be switched on and off.

In cannot be dimmed using by PWM because GPIO16 is not supporting this.

The blue LED on the ESP-12 can also be used GPIO2(D4).


### I2C / WIRE Bus

The internally used I2C Bus for the connection with the OLED is not available at a connector. Therefore it is difficult to add more I2C bus devices to this bus.

Also the board doesn't use the common and default pins that are defined by
SCL=GPIO5(D1) and SDA=GPIO4(D2).

The board uses

* `SCL` = `GPIO4` (`D2`) (yellow) and
* `SDA` = `GPIO5` (`D1`) (blue)


## Board configuration

The display configuration is defined in `env.json` together with the system button and led for configuration.
When pressing the joystick while the LED is blinking the device switches to config mode.

``` json

These are the basic element configurations for the joystick button and the 2 onboard LEDs.
