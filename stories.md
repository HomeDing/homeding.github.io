# Stories

The stories provide a full documentation required to build a specific device for a specific need
with pictures and extensive step-by-step documentation.

These examples can be extended or modified by configuration. Examples on how to configure elements
can be found  in the [recipes collection](recipes.md) and in the [elements documentation](/elements.md).

## Building a Simple Sensor device

The [Outdoor Sensor Story](/stories/story-story-outdoorsensor.md) is about
how to build a device that simply captures the air temperature and humidity parameters
from a DHT22 sensor by using the low-code [Homeding library] and provide a graph with latest values.


## Building a Air Quality Sensor device

The [Air Quality Sensor](/stories/story-airquality.md) is about
how to build an indoor air quality sensor.

The sensors used here are the BME680 for getting temperature, humidity, pressure and organic gas values and the PMS5003 to get density of the micro particles.


## Building a Weather Display

The [Weather Display](/stories/story-weatherdisplay.md) is about
how to build a device with a display to show actual weather conditions from a remote sensor
and the future weather from an internet service.
