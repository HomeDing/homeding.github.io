### SSD1306 OLED Displays
 
<div class="excerpt">
  <img src="/i/sh1106.svg">
  <p>The DisplaySSD1306Element allows connecting a OLED display based on a SSD1306 chip to the board.</p>
</div>

This display implementation features supported by this adapter are:

* 128\*64 or 128\*32 display resolutions
* Text output in the font sizes 10,16 and 24 px.
* Binary output shown as a filled or empty circle

The DisplaySSD1306Element needs to be configured to activate the display adapter for the OLED
displays based on HD44780 chips.

The `DisplayElement` implements the configuration that specifies the hardware related parameters by using the configuration from the configuration file.

The `DisplayAdapter` class implements the communication with the chip that is integrated into the OLED display and connected through the I2C bus by using the Arduino library `ESP8266 and ESP32 Oled Driver for SSD1306 display` that can be installed using the Arduino Library Manager or can be downloaded from
<https://github.com/squix78/esp8266-oled-ssd1306>.

To show some output on the display use the [DisplayText Element](/elements/displaytext) and the [DisplayDot Element](/elements/displaydot)

## Element Configuration

The following properties are available for configuration of the element:

| Property  | Description                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `address` | Specifies the i2c address of the display. |
| `height`  | The height of the display. 32 or 64       |


## Example for Configuration

The configuration of a display is given by the privided hardware and should be configured in the env.json file:

```JSON
"DisplaySSD1306": {
  "0": {
    "address": "60",
    "height": 64
  }
}
```
